A previous migration called 'InitialDBCreation' was already applied to the target database. 
If you meant to re-scaffold 'InitialDBCreation', 
revert it by running: 
- Update-Database -TargetMigration $InitialDatabase 

then delete '202110120312489_InitialDBCreation1.cs' and again run:
- Add-Migration InitialDBCreation
